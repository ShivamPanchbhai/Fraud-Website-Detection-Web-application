# Fraud-Website-Detection-Web-application
In this web application in the first part of the project I implemented Whois lookup 
technique via Java library to get the details of a particular website and added 
an option to download the details and in the second part I have used data mining technique
"pattern recognition" to find a pattern in url to check whether
it passes certain characteristics to not to be a fraud url. 
I have used Spring hibernate framework and had implemented this project on Java 1.7 version via netbeans,
I have used MySql as the database for this project to store user information.


To run this project just download the zip file and open it on netbeans
